# Current State

本文件只记录生命周期较长的项目和工作流状态。它不持久化瞬时 Git 工作区或同步状态。

## Project

- Project: MonoOLED Studio
- Product version: 1.2.3
- Current phase: Real Product TASK E2E Validation completed

## Workflow

- Last completed workflow task: TASK-002
- TASK-001 status: DONE
- TASK-002 status: DONE
- Independent Review: PASS (11/11 acceptance criteria)
- Active task: NONE
- Next workflow action: Review Phase 2 results and decide the next product task or workflow capability

## Current workstream

- Theme Visual Workstream is closed by TASK-002 under the approved product
  decision B.
- Dark theme routing decision resolved: preserve one-dark-pro runtime routing and
  apply approved dark visual tokens there.
- Popup native-mask versus Design System classification remains a
  `DEFERRED FOLLOW-UP CANDIDATE`; TASK-002 does not modify `ui_controls.py` or
  popup tests to resolve it.
- The pre-existing theme files remain auditable through the TASK-002 baseline;
  BLOCKED.md and PROGRESS.md remain local work records outside the product scope.

## Phase 2 Result

ChatGPT × Codex Workflow Phase 2 — Real Product TASK E2E VALIDATED.

TASK-002 completed the full path from user product decision through implementation,
failure evidence, targeted verification, independent review, scope rework, GitHub
Review Baseline publication, control-plane rework, final Independent Review PASS,
and Closure.

## Dynamic repository facts

Before starting or reviewing a task, query these facts from the working tree and remote rather than copying them into this file:

```powershell
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short --branch
git branch -vv
git remote -v
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main
```

The active TASK, `AGENTS.md`, current source and tests, and machine-readable contracts remain the sources for task-specific scope and verification.
